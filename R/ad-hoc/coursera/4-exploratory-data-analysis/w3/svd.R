# SVD has the matrices UDV
# U - Row means - plot to understand differences between rows
# D - Diagonals (variance levels?)
# V - Col means - plot to understand differences between columns

# SVD and PCA (prcomp) are cool, but can't deal with missing values. One way to deal with this is by imputing the missing values. Bioconductor has a package containing the impute.knn function.
